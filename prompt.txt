I have a DataFrame with the following columns:

transaction_id, timestamp, customer_id, stock_ticker (STK001 to STK020), transaction_type (BUY, SELL), quantity, average_trade_size, stock_price, total_trade_amount, customer_account_type(Retail, Institutional), day_name(Monday,Tuesday ..etc), is_weekend, is_holiday, stock_liquidity_tier, stock_sector(Energy, Consumer,Technology, Finance), stock_industry(Utilities,Retail, Software, Assets Management, Oil & Gas, Hardware, Renewables, Pharmaceuticals)

Please generate a dataset description in Markdown format. For each column, provide one sentence explaining its meaning. The output should be ready to copy into a README.md file.



Here’s a clean Markdown dataset description you can directly include in a `README.md` file:
